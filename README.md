# Epistemic Graphs
This project is intended to provide tools to model the relationships between beliefs and arguments as graphs, or epistemic graphs.

Inspired by the following papers:
 - http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/a.hunter/papers/ecsqaru19b.pdf
 - https://www.mthimm.de/pub/2020/Hunter_2020.pdf

Check out how the [current claims look](claims.md).

## Example
Green boxes and arrows indicate supporting arguments, and red the reverse.
